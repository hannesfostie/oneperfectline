subtitle: What One Perfect Line is about
---

One Perfect Line is designed and developed by [Hannes Fostie](http://maloik.co),
a developer and design enthusiast from Belgium.

You'll find short articles on technology, development and music mixed with a
little bit of photography or design. Each article will attempt to convey what I
feel about the subject at hand and is merely my take on life. Don't expect any
groundbreaking journalism.

## The Line

I find that a lot of the things I love all boil down to lines, in particular the
search to that One Perfect Line. This could be the perfect line of code, the
perfect line of words, an incredible guitar- or bassline or drawing the perfect
line in untouched powder snow.

## Tools

I do my writing on a Macbook Pro, develop in Vim using Jekyll and photograph
using a Canon EOS 600D. The font is the Meta family served through Typekit. My
coffee comes from a Bodum burr grinder and is brewed in either an Aeropress, a
French press or a moka express. I blast my music through Alessandro MS2
headphones, sometimes coming from a 35 year old Technics SL-23a record player.

## Contact

If you have questions or feedback for me, please tweet
